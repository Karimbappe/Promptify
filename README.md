## Features

- **User Registration and Authentication**: Users can create an account, log in, and log out. Authentication is handled using Next.js and Next-Auth for a secure and seamless user experience.

- **Prompt Feed**: Users can browse a feed of writing prompts posted by other users. Each prompt displays relevant information such as the prompt content, tags, and the username of the prompt creator.

- **Profile Pages**: Users have personalized profile pages where they can showcase their own prompts, view their activity, and manage their account settings.

- **Search and Filtering**: Users can search for prompts or users using the search bar. The search results are dynamically updated as the user types, allowing for real-time filtering of prompts based on keywords or usernames.

- **Tag Filtering**: Users can click on tags associated with a prompt to filter the feed and view prompts that are specifically related to that tag. This allows for easy exploration of prompts in specific categories or themes.
